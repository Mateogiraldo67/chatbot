# Local Authentication System

This authentication system provides secure user registration and login functionality with local data persistence.

## Features

- Secure password hashing using bcrypt
- User registration with duplicate checking
- User authentication with secure password verification
- Session management
- Technology-agnostic design

## Components

### 1. Data Persistence Layer

The system uses a local database abstraction that can be implemented with various technologies:
- Browser storage (localStorage, IndexedDB)
- File-based storage (JSON, SQLite)
- Embedded databases

### 2. User Schema

Each user record contains:
- Unique identifier
- Username/email (unique)
- Hashed password
- Creation timestamp

### 3. Security Measures

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with 10 salt rounds
- Plain text passwords are never stored
- Session tokens are used for authentication state

## API

### Initialization
```javascript
initializeAuthSystem()
```
Sets up the local database and required configurations.

### User Registration
```javascript
registerUser(username, password)
```
Registers a new user after validating uniqueness and hashing the password.

### User Login
```javascript
loginUser(username, password)
```
Authenticates a user by verifying their credentials and creating a session.

### User Logout
```javascript
logoutUser(sessionId)
```
Invalidates a user session.

### Session Validation
```javascript
validateSession(sessionId)
```
Checks if a session is valid and returns associated user data.

## Implementation Notes

This implementation provides a technology-agnostic foundation that can be adapted to:
- Web browsers (using localStorage or IndexedDB)
- Mobile applications (using platform-specific storage)
- Desktop applications (using file-based or embedded databases)
- Server environments (using SQLite or other lightweight databases)

The core logic remains the same across platforms while the persistence layer can be swapped based on the target environment.
